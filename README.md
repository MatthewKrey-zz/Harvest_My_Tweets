Data Science Experiment 1

As a first venture into the world of Data Science with Python, I found
a recipe for Harvesting & Geolocating Twitter Data in a great book by
Tony Ojeda, Sean Patrick Murphy, Benjamin Bengfort and Abhijit
Dasgupta, “Practical Data Science Cookbook: 89 hands-on recipes to
helpyou complete real-world data science projects in R and Python.”

Not everything will always work exactly as it is written in the recipes
due to updates, new modules, etc., so you will have to do some puzzle
cracking and debugging depending on the project, but this has been a
great resource for getting started and I will always credit these
authors for helping me dive into this new and exciting work! Thank you!
